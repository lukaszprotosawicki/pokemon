    <Page>
      <Title>Pokemons list</Title>
      <p className="text-white py-6 text-center">
        Here will be list of pokemons from pokeapi
      </p>
      <ol className="text-white list-decimal">
        <p className="font-bold">What you need to do</p>
        <li>
          Call pokeapi inside useEffect (remember to not cause infinite loop
          because you'll break pokeapi!) and save the response in state
          (useState)
        </li>
        <li>
          Display list of pokemons (pokeapi uses pagination so keep that in
          mind) like example below
        </li>
        <li>
          [Extra] Add buttons PREVIOUS - NEXT at the bottom so I can load next
          batch of pokemons
        </li>
        <li>
          Handle states:
          <p>Initial</p>
          <p>Loading</p>
          <p>Loaded</p>
          <p>Error</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          Create pokemon profile page, so when I click on selected pokemon I go
          to the specific page where I can see more details about pokemon
          (pokemonId, name, types and avatar). Refer to Favourites, you'll see
          an example. Remember about react-router you have to create new route
          for this and create separate component and separate Route.
        </li>
        <li>
          In detailed view I want to have{" "}
          <span className="font-bold">ADD TO FAVOURITE </span>button which will
          save selected pokemon to{" "}
          <span className="font-bold">localStorage</span> so later I can display
          it in Favourite component. [Extra] Maximum of 6, meaning if I add 7th
          pokemon the first one gets removed from the localStorage
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p className="text-white py-2">
        Example of what I want to see here is something like this
      </p>
      <ol className="poke-font text-white grid grid-cols-2 grid-flow-row-dense gap-1">
        {pokeApiResponse.map((pokemon, index) => (
          <li
            key={pokemon - index}
            className={`hover:bg-red-700 cursor-pointer ${
              index < 10 ? "col-start-1" : "col-start-2"
            }`}
          >
            #{index + 1} - {pokemon.name}
          </li>
        ))}
      </ol>
    </Page>
